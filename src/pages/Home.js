            Concrete around the world is crumbling and cracking. Experts say the estimated cost to repair and improve America's crumbling roads, sidewalks, and bridges is about $200 billion
            (not to mention that poor infrastrcuture costs the average US taxpayer around $3400 a year).

            <p>
            To fix the world's concrete, we're using the power of robotics and computer vision to create a compact, efficient, and affordable robot. Our current prototype
            (nicknamed "P1" for Prototype One) uses an ensemble of computer vision, on-board computing, and a robust drivetrain to effectively detect and fill
            cracks of all shapes and sizes.

                In addition to trying to fix our roads, bridges, and sidewalks, our team is determined to maintain the highest standards
                of eco-friendliness in our products. We are currently accomplishing this by using non-toxic crack fillers and not interfering with bugs, plants, and other creatures.
                As our team works to expand our product line, we will continue to keep our planet's safety in mind.
